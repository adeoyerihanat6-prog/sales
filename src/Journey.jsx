            <h1 className='sroll-left'>Back in November 1983, most Nigerians saw dining out as either foreign <br />
             fast food or roadside stalls. Mama Cass changed that by bringing a true <br />
              taste of home to the table.</h1>
<br />
              <h1 className='scroll-left'>
We began with a simple mission: to serve authentic, home-cooked <br />
 Nigerian meals to busy city professionals and families who wanted real <br />
  comfort food without the wait.</h1>
<br />
  <h1 className='scroll-left'>
Mama Cass is more than just food, it’s a way to relive special moments. <br />
From smoky Jollof rice to soft pounded yam and our unique Ofada rice, <br />
 every dish takes you back to those warm Sundays with family and joyful <br />
  village celebrations. Each meal is a proud reminder of Nigeria’s rich <br />
   culinary heritage.</h1>
